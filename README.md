#Building/downloading definition graphs

Before you can use the module you'll need to get two precompiled definition graphs, [one](http://people.mokk.bme.hu/~recski/pymachine/4lang.pickle) built from 4lang and [another](http://people.mokk.bme.hu/~recski/pymachine/4lang.pickle) from LDOCE (you can also build your own graph from 4lang after downloading it from [GitHub](https://github.com/kornai/4lang))

Once you have the graph binaries, make sure your config file (machine.cfg or similar) points to them.
