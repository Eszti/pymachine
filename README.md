#Building/downloading definition graphs
Before you can use the module you'll need to get two precompiled definition graphs, one built from 4lang and another from LDOCE.
You can also build your own graph from 4lang after downloading it from https://github.com/kornai/4lang
Once you have the graph binaries, make sure your config file (machine.cfg or similar) points to them.
