- searching in machine tree
  - search
    - query machines (QM)
      - printname: regex
      - control: control.match()
      - partitions: further QMs
    - bool operations over QMs
    - results contain
      - path to result
      - all matching subtree
    - QMs have pointers in order to identify which children is matching
      - ZsA have doubts about this
  - operations


- <default> value handling
  - first, they should be only strings
  - later they should be "printnames", while normal
    properties shoulb be machine pointers (this means
    there may be actually no existing machine with
    this printname)
