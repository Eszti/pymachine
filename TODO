- tests for the new parser
- things with same name inside one definition should point to the same machine
- apostrophe stuff
- <default> value handling
  - first, they should be only strings
  - later they should be "printnames", while normal
    properties shoulb be machine pointers (this means
    there may be actually no existing machine with
    this printname)
